# File sharing for [Kiwi IRC](https://kiwiirc.com)

* Upload files from you computer / device
* Take a webcam photo or video
* Paste files / images directly into Kiwi IRC
* Auto delete files after a time period

This plugin includes a file uploading server that will store any user uploaded files on the
server and then offer them as file downloads with a unique URL. The option to delete files
after a set time period discourages users from using the server as a permanent file store.

#### Dependencies
* golang (https://golang.org/dl/ - for building as standalone)
* yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/ - for the kiwiirc plugin UI)

#### Downloading the file upload server's source code

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kiwiirc/plugin-fileuploader.git && cd plugin-fileuploader
```

#### Running the file upload server from source

```console
$ go run .
```

#### Building the server for production

```console
$ go build
```

#### Running the server as a webircgateway plugin

Add the following to the webircgateway config:

```ini
[plugins]
plugins/fileuploader.so
```

Adjust `BasePath` and `CorsOrigins` as needed in `fileuploader.config.toml`.

Create a symlink to `plugin-fileuploader/webircgateway-plugin/fileuploader-server.go` in `webircgateway/plugins/fileuploader/plugin.go`.

Run `make` in the `webircgateway/` folder to build the plugin.

Start the webircgateway.

#### Building the Kiwi IRC plugin

The kiwi plugin is the javascript file that you link to in your kiwiirc configuration. It is the front end that provides the upload UI.

* `$ yarn start` will start a webpack development server that hot-reloads the plugin as you develop it. Use the URL `http://localhost:9000/main.js` as the plugin URL in your kiwiirc configuration.
* `$ yarn build` will build the final plugin that you can use in production. It will be built into dist/main.js.

##### Loading the plugin into kiwiirc
Add the plugin javascript file to your kiwiirc `config.json` and configure the settings:

```json
{
	"plugins": [
		{
			"name": "fileuploader",
			"url": "http://localhost:9000/plugin-fileuploader.js"
		}
	],
	"fileuploader": {
		"server": "http://localhost:8088/files",
		"maxFileSize": 10485760,
		"note": "Add an optional note to the upload dialog"
	}
}
```

If you're running the fileuploader server as a webircgateway plugin, use the webircgateway hostname, e.g.

```json
	"server": "https://ws.irc.example.com/files",
```

## Database configuration
File uploads are logged into a database. Currently the supported databases are sqlite3 and mysql.

* `Database.Type` can either be `sqlite3` or `mysql`. The default is `sqlite3`.
* `Database.Path` is the path to your database file for sqlite3. For mysql it is a DSN in the format `user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/database`. See: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name
